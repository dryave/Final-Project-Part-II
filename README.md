Here is my final project part II! 

# User Research Protocol: Daniel Ryave Telling Stories with Data Final Project Part 2

My goal for this presentation is to convince graduate students who have limited to no knowledge of malaria to be able to do the following things:
1.	Understand the cause and treatment/prevention options for malaria
2.	Determine which interventions are particularly effective and which interventions are particularly cost-effective
3.	Be motivated to call their congressperson to encourage increased foreign aid spending or donate to a worthy NGO 

# User Testing
In order to understand if my presentation is achieving these goals, I sat down with three graduate students who did not know what the cause of malaria is. (In my experience, people who can’t identify the cause of malaria don’t generally know much about treatment or prevention methods.) My theory held true in this case; the three graduate students with whom I spoke had a lot to learn about malaria. 

My user script was likely longer than most user scripts would be, as I wanted to educate them in the same way that my final presentation will. But I also wanted to give them a lot of room to dissect the information and story boards on their own and provide me with feedback. Here is what I said to my storyboard research subjects:

1.	Thank you for helping me with my project. Today we’ll be talking about malaria and how interventions can help reduce the malaria disease burden. Before we start, what can you tell me about malaria? 
2.	Thanks for sharing your knowledge. We’re going to focus on sub-Saharan Africa specifically because the malaria disease rate is the highest there than in any other region on earth. Let me walk you through my presentation. Please share any thoughts that pop into your head as we go.
3.	The first component is a description of malaria and some statistics to show how mortality has changed over the years. How do these graphs make you feel? What jumps into your mind?
4.	Next, we’ll look at a timeline of interventions. How would you interact with this timeline if it were on a screen in front of you?
5.	I lived in Togo, West Africa, for two years, and I saw firsthand the burden that malaria can have on families. Let’s look specifically at Togo so that we can see some interventions and how they have made an impact. We’ll look at the timeline and the effectiveness. How do you feel about storyboard parts 4 and 5? 
6.	Here are the key takeaways of this project: Malaria has wreaked havoc on sub-Saharan Africa for years, and although interventions exist, the problem is still there. Interventions can be successful but are not always fiscally responsible. The best interventions that have the least cost impact are x, y, and z. What do you think about this summary?
7.	The call to action is that I want you as an audience member to be excited to donate to an NGO supporting an intervention that you support. What do you think of the call to action?
8.	Overall, what are your feelings about the presentation? What do you really like and what do you dislike?
9.	What would you like to see changed? Any feedback here is welcome!
10.	Thank you for helping me with this project.

# Findings from interviews and changes to implement

My interviewees were extremely helpful in their frank and candid feedback. Here are some pieces of feedback I received and how I made edits into my second storyboard.
1.	The title “Malaria Today: How YOU can help” is not as strong as it could be, according to the people I interviewed. It sounded a little cliché and not very specific. I changed it to: “Malaria in sub-Saharan African: A crisis that can be solved.”
2.	The graphs in storyboard slide 2 did not accurately prove the point I wanted to that malaria is still a pressing issue. To address this, I changed the graph on the right from the rate of mortality to the absolute mortality to show that deaths are growing.
3.	Two people mentioned that they thought it was disconnected that some graphs talked about under 5 mortality and some with the overall population. To encourage continuity, I changed it all to under 5 mortality. 
4.	The intervention timeline was really well received by my interviewees! I’m excited to build it.
5.	Separating slides 3 and 5 in the first storyboard didn’t help with continuity. To help with this, I rearranged slides 4 and 5 to keep interventions together. I think I like this approach, but I may want to move the Togo information to after slide 2. I will have a better idea after I build out the project a little more.
6.	One person mentioned that my graph in slide 5 is a little busy and may be better by plotting efficacy and cost instead of efficacy and year, since old interventions may not be useful. Honestly, I’m not sure if I like this change or not, and I am eager for feedback from other interviewees when I test my second storyboard.
7.	Two people mentioned that my presentation would be stronger if it were more personal. To do this, I plan to introduce a story about someone in Togo who has experienced malaria. 
8.	The interviewees mentioned that the takeaways seemed to logically follow the presentation based on how I presented the storyboard, but it may be harder to communicate all of that information in the 60-second presentation.

# Personas

It was clear after my interviewees offered such targeted feedback that I needed to do a better job identifying my target audience member. So in order to do that I created a persona. Here's what the prototypical persona for my target audience member might look like:

Name: Alex

Year: Second Year Heinz student 

Interests: Arts, policy, healthcare

Knowledge on malaria: Knows it's a mosquito-related disease that affects many people in "Africa." Doesn't have much more granular knowledge on how malaria works. 

How to capture their attention: Exciting information presented in a new way. Has many competing priorities and likely won't give full attention to this presentation if it isn't extremely useful or novel. 

Political engagement: Alex is knowledgable on politics and can name their congressperson and plans to vote in the upcoming election. If Alex is asked to engage with politics, either by calling a politician, voting for a certian candidate, or even donating a small amount of money to a certain person or cause, Alex is willing to be convinced. With that said, Alex is quite busy and would not give up time to go to a rally or engage in a long-term way.

# Take a look at my skeletal outline for my Shorthand final presentation!
There is certainly a lot to add and a lot to sketch out. I wanted to put in my thoughts and continue to add over the Thanksgiving Break. The rough sketches I did for my storyboards are not far from the true data, so when I actually create the visualistions during the upcoming weeks, I'm excited to play around with which type of graphs tell my story in the most engaging and easy to process way. Thank you in advance for your feedback!
